I never want to see this code again

<h1>THIS WAS MADE AS PART OF A SCHOOL PROJECT AND IS IN NO WAY A FINISHED PRODUCT</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Features include, but are not limited to</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Database connection (mongoDB)</li>
  <li>Matching algorithm for users (very primitive, basically a random number gen)</li>
  <li>Cool sliding stack</li>
  <li>Cool animation that try to cover up how buggy and messy the code is</li>
  <li>A bunch of dependencies i never actually use</li>
  <li>0 security protocol, you can probably get into the database by accident</li>
</ul>
